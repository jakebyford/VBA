# VBA Challenge

Inside this repo is the VBA script to compile the MultiYearStockData excel file. 
The script compiles through each stock analyzing the year over year change, yearly percent change,
and takes the sum of the daily volume per individual stock. After running through the 
first analysis, the script finds the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and Greatest 
Total Volume throughout the year.

This script successfully compiles for the MultiYearStockData macro enabled worksheets.
